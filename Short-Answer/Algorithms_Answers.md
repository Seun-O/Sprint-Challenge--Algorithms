#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) runtime O(n) because the loops runtime scales linearly with the input N


b) runtime O(n^2) There are two loops that will run in proportion to what N is


c) runtime O(n) It is a recursive problem which would run N times

## Exercise II
stories = number of floors
f = max building before egg brakes

for i in range(stories):
     if i >= f:
         print("egg broke")

 Complexity = O(logn)
